## This course helped me in continuing to build Python data science skills

### Chapter 1: Using iterators in PythonLand
In this chapter, I  learned about iterators and iterables and practised by loading twitter data in chunks using iterators.
### Chapter 2: List comprehensions and generators
In this chapter, I built on my knowledge of iterators and I was introduced to list comprehensions.
### Chapter 3: Bringing it all together!
In this chapter, I applied the newly acquired skills toward wrangling and extracting meaningful information from a real-world datasetâ€”the World Bank's World Development Indicators.
