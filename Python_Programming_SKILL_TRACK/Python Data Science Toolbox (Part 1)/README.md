## This course helps in learning key concepts of writing functions in Python as well as scoping and error handling.

### Chapter 1 : Writing your own functions
a  simple Twitter analysis was conducted by developing a function that counts how many tweets are in certain languages using the tweets.csv data, The output of the function was a dictionary that had the language as 
the keys and the counts of tweets in that language as the value.

### Chapter 2 : Default arguments, variable-length arguments and scope 
generalized the Twitter language analysis from chapter 1 to include a default argument for the colomn name  then generalize it one step further by allowing the user to pass it a flexible argument -in our case- as many column names as the user would like.
