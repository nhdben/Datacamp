## This course helps in learning key concepts of writing functions in Python as well as scoping and error handling.

### Chapter 1 : Writing your own functions
In this chapter I conducted a  simple Twitter analysis by developing a function that counts how many tweets are in certain languages using the tweets.csv data, The output of the function was a dictionary that had the language as 
the keys and the counts of tweets in that language as the value.

### Chapter 2 : Default arguments, variable-length arguments and scope 
In this chapter, I generalized the Twitter language analysis from chapter 1 to include a default argument for the column name then generalize it one step further by allowing the user to pass it a flexible argument -in our case- as many column names as the user would like.
 
### Chapter 3 : Lambda functions and error-handling
In this chapter I learned how to write anonymous functions using lambda, how to pass lambda functions as arguments to other functions such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), as well as how to write errors and output custom error messages within functions. 
and at the end, I learned how to improve my work by adding helpful messages using both try-except block and raise exceptions.
